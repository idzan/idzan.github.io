Allright, web host - check, CMS - let's say check, site - check.
I think that is all you need to run Jekyll based web site, am I right?

So, to be clear, this is one major redesign which happened lately. Now you all might think:

*Jeez, this site sucks, design is too basic, and where the heck is my WordPress based site, what is this HTML5 crap.*

First of all, thank you for noticing some major changes. Let me say one thing: for my site WordPress is overkill. Let's face it, I'm lazy with blogging lately. Also, for me it is easier and also waay cheaper to get I don't know [GitHub](https://github.com){:target="_blank"} Pages feature which is **FREE**. Yes, you read this right - it's free.

Actually, it have some limitations but those don't mind me now especially when you can check source code of web site right on my new [GitHub Profile](https://github.com/idzan){:target="_blank"} which is for me, OK and acceptable. In all seriousnes maybe some of you designers can give me some ideas how to make site more visually compliant with latest design ideas.

Now, this is last part - but wait, where are all projects that you made, and some blog posts.
This is not trick answer but it is a bit complicated.

As I wrote, I'm hosting page on GitHub and for GitHub pages to make aeverything like this post looks great I use Jekyll, one great and sime tool which can with some simple learning of how Jekyll works and Liquid markdown (no pun intended, but this post is wrote in Markdown). For this site it took me some time with ideas how to get Portfolio working, and answer is - just view Source Code.

I'm back, site is back and I'm going to improve site, especially with new blog posts and fixes to current mess of old and possibly broken links.
