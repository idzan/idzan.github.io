It is time to get back into blogging scene.
That's right I'm back in blogging world. It was a while when i last time posted something online, and now today I'm getting back with refreshed blog on my domain which is now hosted on [GitHub](https://github.com){:target="_blank" rel="noopener"} .

That is right, all readers of this blog and visitors of web site.

Web is fully Serverless, which means no PHP, no CMS at all, just pure HTML, CSS, Vanilla JS and of course markdown.

Source of this new project can be found at [repository](https://github.com/idzan/idzan.github.io){:target="_blank" rel="noopener"} .
