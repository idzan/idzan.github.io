This is one small project which I created for “maskice.hr” Web Shop and Web Site to improve delivery and Shipping information’s which are provided by customer to adjust Shipping Cost while company used provider which had different price depending on shipping location. Extension was tried to integrate into WooCommerce Core on GitHub but unfortunately, they canceled my pull because of i18n validation of County names in English. All States/Counties are in Croatian and they are ready to be translated.
