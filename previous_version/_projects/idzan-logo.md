Latest and hopefully final Official Logo is project which had idea started back in December 2018. as sketch in notebook made with pencil. Idea was to have one letter or maximum of two in some clean shape like rectangle or circle. It was decided in March to use single letter and name under rectangle. Also rectangle have two small lines in two opposite parts of rectangle. Logo is built with Adobe Illustrator CC 2019 and it is in two basic colors - black for logo, and white for background (in SVG version background is transparent) so it can be asily adapted to any background color.
