Marko Idzan's Official Android™ Application is conversion of my personal web site, blog and portfolio to simple Android Application which uses TWA (Trusted Web Application) from Chrome™ version 72 and newer or Chrome™ Tab Feature from for older versions of Google Chrome™ installed on phone.

Application works Offline and even can load images while Offline. Also application would integrate Web Push Notifications for checking out latest Blog posts, later in web development.

[Get it from Google™ Play Store](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=marko.idzan.twa)
