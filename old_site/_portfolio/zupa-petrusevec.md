Website of The parish of St. Vitus (Croatian: Župa sv. Vida, Zagreb-Petruševec) was originaly created in 2008. In early days of website it was powered on pure HTML and some JavaScript. I got on administration place in April of 2010. First major change was in 2012, when was website switched to WordPress. In next 6 years there was few major design changes, and lot of small changes to website. Latest design use Flatsome by UX-Themes as base for other changes. Latest change came in May of 2018. after long time on previous theme which got obsolete. On website there is bunch of new images, credits go to myself.
