Web Site hocunamore.hr (Hoću na more) started as small idea for restarting and rebuilding web site for Šimun Emanuel Putovanja's domain and web site which they got year ago, but after some problems with CMS and hacks they closed it for good. Website is rebuilt using WordPress as CMS now, and it uses theme "Travel Tour" from "GoodLayers" with integrated tours section to showcase where they get every weekend on Adriatic Sea (Jadransko more). In near future there would be integrated web shop for purchasing tickets right from web site.
