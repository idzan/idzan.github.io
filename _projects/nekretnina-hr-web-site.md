“Nekretnina.hr” Web Site was started in May 2018. as first-time idea about redesign of old design of site. At first it was just simple promotional site without much of features, but how work progressed it got upgraded from simple promotional site up to project which use “Reality” theme with custom feature built into it which is custom Dashboard for inserting and editing Real Estates. Site is also connected with platform “Dimedia Nekretnine” for checkups of information’s used from owner of Real Estate and so it can be easily shared on multiple Real Estate networks.
